## Quick Start

Install `nevo` via _npm_

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev nevo # yarn add --dev nevo
```

Include `nevo` in your project

```scss
// project/main.scss

@use 'nevo' as *;
```

_The `@use` rule is the primary replacement for `@import`. [More info](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched)_

That's it! ðŸ¤™

## Documentation

Full documentation in progress. ðŸš§

If you're familiar with `SASS/SCSS`, feel free to try `nevo`.

## Additional info

Nevo is inspired by Tailwind CSS, so the naming convention for utilities and development experience in HTML are very similar.

Nevo is a `SASS-powered` framework.
